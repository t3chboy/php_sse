comparison_long poll_vs_websockets_sse

Long Polling : 
It requires everytime 3 way trips
Timeouts via/from proxy server if waited for too long.
For php apps keep memory occuiped till the connection closes.

Short Polling : 
Multiple calls are required.

Websockets:
suited best for frequent 2 way communication.
Multiplexing over http/2 not possible since web socket is different protocol.
without ssl webcoskets dont work across.


Server sent events:
Can work with http/2 multiplexing.
Provides more advantage as http/2 + sterams.
Unique ID can be used to idenitfy each message, which is helpful for fetching lost data on re-connection.
Connection doesnt close like Long polling after data transfer so can be helpful in streaming data.
